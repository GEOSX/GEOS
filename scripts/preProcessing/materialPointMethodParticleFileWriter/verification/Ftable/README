Test of the prescibed F-table and boundary condition table capability.

An elastic block is loaded in tensile uniaxial strain, using prescibed F loading.
The lateral boundaries are then freed using outflow BCs so that subsequent loading is uniaxial stress.

Material is then unloaded to zero strain.

Reactions are plotted against the expected result for an elastic material

Initial slope is constrained modulus, 2nd leg is young's modulus, 3rd leg unloads with young's modulus.

The Mathematica notebook 'rotateParticles.nb' can be used to rotate particles in-place to see the effect of grid-alignment.
